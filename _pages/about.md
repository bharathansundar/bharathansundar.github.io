<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a final-year undergraduate in mathematics at Caltech. My research interests are broadly in statistical learning, optimization, and causal inference. I am also interested in methods and applications in high-dimensional statistics, online and reinforcement learning, and experimental design. 

At Caltech, I have worked primarly with Prof. John Preskill on quantum information theory and Prof. Eric Mazumdar on online optimization. My (leisurely) mathematical interests include probabilistic methods in analysis, combinatorics, and theoretical computer science. I play tennis for Caltech, and my favorite artist is [Young Thug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Thug). 

Some things I have been reading recently:
- on statistical decision making in public [policy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03457)
